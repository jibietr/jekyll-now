title: R tip #1: Use colnames instead of column numbers
---

I recently started working on a Data Science project with and old friend
who is learning how to use R. I thought I could take the opportunity to 
put together all those tips that I learned why learning R during last years
and that may be useful to those that are initating on it.

R tip #1: Do not use column numbers. Use colnames instead.
